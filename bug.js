This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The issue is that Tailwind's JIT (Just-in-Time) mode might not correctly process your CSS classes if there are conflicting or incomplete class names.  For example, if you have a typo in a class name, or if you're using a class that's not defined in your `tailwind.config.js` file, Tailwind might not compile the CSS correctly. This results in the class not being applied to your element.  The code below shows a situation where a typo in the class name `text-xl` leads to the failure to style the text.
