The solution is to correct the typo in the class name and ensure all classes are correctly defined in your `tailwind.config.js`.  Use a linter to catch these errors early, and always verify your class names for accuracy.  Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p className="text-xl">This text is now correctly styled.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
